# Clover
The main purpose of Clover is to learn by creating. My first objective with Clover was to create a basic client-server model with sockets. Also, I wanted to learn about cmake and google test. Now that it's done, new objectives have been set like more complex communication and creating a really simple basic engine with entities that are moving.
## To Do
- [x] A client communicating with a server that echo back
- [x] Multiple clients communicating with a server that echo back
- [x] Make project compatible with Linux (already working on Windows)
- [x] Multiple clients communicating with a server that broadcast the message like in a general chat
- [x] Basic entity with position
